The server was created using nodeJS, so it must be installed on the computer in order to run.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the CREATivators folder and run the command: "npm install --save", which will install the necessary dependencies onto your computer.

Now run the command: “node server.js”. This starts the server on the localhost port 8080.

Open “Positive Pathways” in Android Studio and navigate to the file “strings.xml.” Modify the variable “server_url” and set it to the computer’s current IP address to test on a physical device, or “10.0.2.2” if you are using an emulator on a computer without internet access.

Start the emulator. Here, we will use a Nexus emulator. The application is already installed on the phone, but we run any updates from the Android Studio IDE’s “Run” function. The application compiles and runs on the selected emulator or connected device for testing purposes.
